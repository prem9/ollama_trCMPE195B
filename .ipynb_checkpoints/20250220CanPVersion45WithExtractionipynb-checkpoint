       "[Document(metadata={'source': './context.txt'}, page_content=\"ï»¿* P-value: The p-value is a measure that helps scientists determine whether their findings are significant or just due to chance. A low p-value (usually less than 0.05) suggests that the results are likely not random and are worth paying attention to.\\n* Confidence Interval: A confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true value of something (like an average or effect) is expected to lie. For example, if a study says the average height is 170 cm with a 95% confidence interval of 160-180 cm, it means we can be 95% sure the true average height is between 160 and 180 cm.\\n* Odds Ratio: The odds ratio is a way to compare whether the odds of a certain event happening are the same for two groups. For example, if you're comparing the odds of getting a disease in people who smoke versus those who don't, an odds ratio of 2 would mean smokers are twice as likely to get the disease.\\n* Correlation Coefficient: The correlation coefficient measures how closely two things are related to each other. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means a perfect positive relationship, -1 means a perfect negative relationship, and 0 means no relationship at all. For example, a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between hours studied and exam scores would suggest that more studying is strongly associated with higher scores.\\n* Hazard Ratio: A measure of how quickly an event (e.g., death or disease progression) occurs in one group compared to another over time. An HR less than 1 indicates a lower risk in the treatment group. Example: An HR of 0.7 means the new drug reduces the risk of death by 30% compared to the old drug.\\n* Relative Risk: The ratio of the probability of an outcome (e.g., side effects or recovery) occurring in the treatment group compared to the control group. Example: An RR of 0.5 for side effects means the new drug halves the risk of side effects compared to the old drug.\\n* Absolute Risk Reduction: The difference in risk of an outcome between two groups, showing the actual reduction in risk due to the treatment. Example: If 10% of patients on the old drug experience side effects and only 5% on the new drug do, the ARR is 5%.\\n* Number Needed to Treat: The number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome (e.g., death or disease progression). Example: An NNT of 20 means 20 people need to take the new drug to prevent one additional death compared to the old drug.\\n* Number Needed to Harm: The number of patients who need to be treated for one additional person to experience a harmful outcome (e.g., side effects). Example: An NNH of 50 means 50 people need to take the new drug for one additional person to experience a side effect compared to the old drug.\\n* Survival Rate: The percentage of people who survive for a specific period (e.g., 1 year or 5 years) after starting treatment. Example: A 5-year survival rate of 80% means 80% of patients taking the new drug are still alive after 5 years.\\n* Progression-Free Survival: The length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives without the disease getting worse. Example: A PFS of 12 months means patients typically go 12 months without their condition worsening on the new drug, compared to 8 months on the old drug.\\n* Adverse Event: Any negative side effect or problem that occurs during treatment, whether related to the drug or not. Example: Nausea, fatigue, or headaches reported during a clinical trial are recorded as adverse events.\\n* Quality-Adjusted Life Years: A measure that combines the length and quality of life gained from a treatment, often used to compare the overall benefit of different treatments. Example: A new drug that adds 2 years of life at 80% quality of life provides 1.6 QALYs.\\n* Risk-Benefit Ratio: A comparison of the risks (e.g., side effects) and benefits (e.g., improved survival) of a treatment to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks. Example: A new drug with a high survival benefit but mild side effects has a favorable risk-benefit ratio.\\n* Sensitivity: The ability of a test to correctly identify people who have the disease. For example, a test with 90% sensitivity correctly detects the disease in 90 out of every 100 people who have it.\\n* Specificity: The ability of a test to correctly identify people who do not have the disease. For example, a test with 95% specificity correctly identifies 95 out of every 100 healthy individuals as disease-free.\\n* Positive Predictive Value (PPV): The likelihood that someone who has a positive test result actually has the disease. For example, a PPV of 80% means 8 out of 10 people with positive test results truly have the condition.\\n* Negative Predictive Value (NPV): The likelihood that someone who has a negative test result actually does not have the disease. For example, an NPV of 90% means that 9 out of 10 people with negative test results truly don't have the condition.\\n* Incidence Rate: The number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specific time frame among a defined group of people. For example, an incidence rate of 5 per 1,000 people per year means that every year, 5 new cases occur for every 1,000 people in the group.\\n* Prevalence: The total number of people who have a certain disease or condition at a specific point in time. For example, if the prevalence of diabetes in a community is 10%, it means 10 out of every 100 people have diabetes at that time.\\n* Mortality Rate: The number of deaths caused by a disease in a population within a certain period, usually expressed per 1,000 or 100,000 people per year. For example, a mortality rate of 20 per 100,000 means that out of every 100,000 people, 20 die of that disease each year.\\n* Intention-to-Treat Analysis (ITT): A method where all participants in a clinical trial are analyzed according to the group they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they completed the treatment. It helps provide a realistic view of the treatment's effectiveness in real-world conditions.\\n* Median Survival: The time point at which half of the patients in a study group are still alive, and half have died. For instance, a median survival of 18 months means half of the patients survived beyond 18 months.\")]"

The authors conducted a comprehensive review of existing research on the topic, analyzing data from 22 clinical trials involving over 1,500 participants.\\n\\n**Key Findings:**\\n\\n* Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis (cell death) in various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and colon cancer.\\n* The authors found a significant reduction in cancer risk among individuals with higher omega-3 intake, suggesting a potential preventive effect.\\n* Omega-3 fatty acids also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, which may contribute to their anticancer effects.\\n\\n**Implications for Cancer Patients:**\\n\\nWhile the results are promising, it\\'s essential to note that this study is based on observational data and animal models. More human clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.\\n\\nThe authors suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be a useful adjunctive therapy in cancer treatment, potentially improving outcomes and reducing side effects. However, patients should consult with their healthcare providers before making any changes to their diet or supplement regimen.\\n\\n**General Guidance:**\\n\\nWhile omega-3 fatty acids are generally considered safe, high doses can increase the risk of bleeding. Patients taking anticoagulant medications or experiencing bleeding disorders should exercise caution when consuming omega-3 supplements.\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n\\n* Consult with a healthcare professional before adding omega-3 supplements to your regimen.\\n* Consider incorporating omega-3 rich foods, such as fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, into your diet.\\n* Maintain a balanced diet and consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized guidance.\\n\\n**Disclaimer:**\\n\\nThis summary is based on the article\\'s content and should not be considered medical advice. Patients should always consult with their healthcare providers before making any decisions about their treatment or care.'"
